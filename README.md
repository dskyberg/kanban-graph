# kanban-graph
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Sandbox app to play with GraphQL, Apollo Client and React.
This client SPA leverages the Apollo Server in [apollo-koa-graphql](https://github.com/dskyberg/apollo-koa-graphql)

The app also leverages my demo of [oidc-provider](https://github.com/dskyberg/oidc-server) for authentication.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
